## üõ† Getting Started

You can configure the plugin through the config.yml or without OP permissions directly through the GUI in-game.

1. **Install:**  
   Place `TwitchRandomizer.jar` into your server's plugins folder.

2. **Configure Twitch Integration:**  
    - Open the GUI with `/trgui`; in the top left, you'll find the "twitch-info" book.
    - Insert your `Broadcaster Username` by left-clicking on the book, then confirm with `done`.
    - Insert your `Bot OAuth` by right-clicking on the book, then confirm with `done`.  
      You can get your OAuth token here: https://twitchtokengenerator.com/quick/1KRFjxyoNE  
      Make sure the following scopes are active: `bits.read`, `chat:read`, `channel:read:subscriptions` and `user:read:subscriptions`.

3. **Reload/Restart:**  
    If you use the GUI, you don't need to restart the server.

4. **Set up your trigger**  
    You can test your connection. With the test triggers enabled (find them in the `Debug Menu`), you can simulate events like a sub (`!test` or `!gift`) or a sub gift bomb (`!giftbomb`).

    **MAKE SURE YOUR TIMER IS RUNNING! OTHERWISE, YOU CAN'T ADD EVENTS TO THE QUEUE THROUGH TWITCH!**

    If you want to add some events to the queue, you can simply use the command `/queue add <AMOUNT> <Username>`. This also works when the timer isn't running!
